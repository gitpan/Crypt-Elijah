Crypt::Elijah - A Perl5 encryption module 
=========================================

This module provides a simple API for symmetric data encryption using the 
Elijah cipher. The cipher itself uses a 128-bit key and operates as a stream 
cipher. You may emulate a block cipher (in ECB mode) by encrypting small chunks 
of data at a time. When emulating a block cipher you need to handle block 
cipher modes yourself; this module will not do CBC/CFB/OFB/CTR for you. 

To install, the regular...

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Then, for usage information...

    perldoc Crypt::Elijah

This module does not depend on other CPAN modules.
